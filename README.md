## Overview
With the growing use of GenAI systems (e.g., ChatGPT), emotionally expressive chatbots are becoming a new channel for product discovery and consumer decision-making. This project studies whether emotional expression in an LLM-based product recommendation chatbot improves or harms user responses (engagement, satisfaction, purchase intention), and how this depends on expectation confirmation/violation, product type, and perceived human likeness. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
